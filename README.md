# MineSweeper
making my own mine sweeper game in progress

I started this project since November 2017. I used my spare time to implement it, sometime I would work on it two weeks straight,
sometime just do nothing for a month or so. upown today Tuesday May 22, 2018. Eventually, I want to add in my own twist to
the game, but for now. this game just a copy of build-in window PC MineSweeper game you can find in any Window laptop.

This game is fully playable and user can change level though option panel. User also can save the game to play next time.
The functionalilties of checking game record will be implemented in the future.

Java version: 
   java version "1.8.0_172"
